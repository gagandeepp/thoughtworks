User Id is: ttDT1_hcK

In this game, you will have to solve series of programming challenges till you hit the finish line. But there's a bit of a twist to it.

The whole game is driven by HTTP REST APIs. You can read about REST at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer

Few important guidelines:
1. For every API call, pass your UserID as an HTTP header with key "userId". Your userId is <ttDT1_hcK>. If you don't do this step, you will receive an "Invalid user!‚Äù error.
2. For every POST API call, you need to pass "content-type" as "application/json" as well.
3. For every API call, use the host as https://http-hunt.thoughtworks-labs.net

So how should you start playing?
Hit an endpoint GET https://http-hunt.thoughtworks-labs.net/challenge which would give you further instructions.
